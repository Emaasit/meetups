Abstract
--------

Machine Learning has gone mainstream and now powers several real world applications like autonomous vehicles at Uber & Tesla, recommendation engines on Amazon & Netflix, and much more. This meetup will introduce probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/). We will discuss the basics of machine learning from a [probabilistic/Bayesian perspective](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) and contrast it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning.

We will also discuss how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called [Probabilistic Programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home) (PP). Particularly we shall use Stan (within R), a PP language, to build models ranging from simple generalized linear models to complex hierarchical models and nonparametric models for machine learning.

Speaker Bio:
------------

[Daniel Emaasit](http://www.danielemaasit.com/) is a PhD student of Transportation Engineering at UNLV. His research interests involve developing [flexible probabilistic/Bayesian machine learning models](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) for high-dimensional data with applications to urban mobility, travel demand modeling, and highway safety analysis.
