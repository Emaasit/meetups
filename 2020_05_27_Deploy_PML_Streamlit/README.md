Abstract
--------

Rapidly build and deploy probabilistic machine learning Apps, using Streamlitâ€™s
open-source app framework. Make your Apps easily accessible to end users who
don't have Bayesian expertise & without having to go through long product-release
cycles. As a case study, we shall use PyMC3 to build a probabilistic model that estimates the reproduction metric of COVID-19. Then we shall quickly build an App using
Streamlit. All in pure Python.

Speaker Bio:
------------

[Daniel Emaasit](http://www.danielemaasit.com/) is a Data Scientist at [Haystax Technology](https://www.haystax.com/). His interests involve developing principled [probabilistic models](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) for problems where training data are scarce by leveraging knowledge from subject-matter experts and context information. In particular, he interested in [flexible](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) [probabilistic machine learning methods](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html), such as Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and data-efficient learning methods such as [Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2599) and [model-based reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06491).

Daniel is also a Ph.D. Candidate of Transportation Engineering at [UNLV](http://www.unlv.edu/) where his research in [nonparametric Bayesian](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) methods is focused on developing flexible-statistical models for traveler-behavior analytics.
