Abstract
--------

Machine Learning has gone mainstream and now powers several real world applications like autonomous vehicles at Uber & Tesla, recommendation engines on Amazon & Netflix, and much more. This meetup will introduce probabilistic machine learning and probabilistic programming with [PyMC3](http://docs.pymc.io/). We will discuss the basics of machine learning from a [probabilistic/Bayesian perspective](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) and contrast it with traditional/algorithmic machine learning.

We will also discuss how to build probabilistic models in computer code using a new exciting programming paradigm called [Probabilistic Programming](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home) (PP). Particularly we shall use PyMC3, a PP language, to build models ranging from simple generalized linear models to complex hierarchical models and nonparametric models for machine learning.

Pre-requisites:

Speaker Bio:
------------

[Daniel Emaasit](http://www.danielemaasit.com/) is a Data Scientist at [Haystax Technology](https://www.haystax.com/). His interests involve developing principled [probabilistic models](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html) for problems where training data are scarce by leveraging knowledge from subject-matter experts and context information. In particular, he interested in [flexible](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) [probabilistic machine learning methods](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/bayesian.html), such as Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and data-efficient learning methods such as Bayesian optimization.

Daniel is also a Ph.D. Candidate of Transportation Engineering at [UNLV](http://www.unlv.edu/) where his research in [nonparametric Bayesian](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/topics/#np) methods is focused on developing flexible-statistical models for traveler-behavior analytics.
